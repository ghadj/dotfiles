# dotfiles
This is a repo to keep my .*rc and other config files versioned. Just clone it to some directory and copy files to your home to try them out. Don't forget to backup your personal files before!

# For settting up
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ghadj/dotfiles.git
cp -Rf $HOME/dotfiles/. $HOME/
rm -rf dotfiles
```
